I am Liu Zhang, a Research Fellow at the SYmmetric cryptography and machine Learning Lab (SyLLab), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, where I have been working since February 2025 (supervised by Prof. Thomas Peyrin). I received my Ph.D. degree in December 2024 from the School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University (supervised by Prof. Zilong Wang). From October 2022 to September 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at NTU’s School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (supervised by Prof. Jian Guo), supported by the China Scholarship Council.  

My research interests include differential-neural cryptanalysis, neural-inspired approaches to integral cryptanalysis, and deep-learning-based leakage modeling for side-channel analysis. Overall, I aim to develop practical, data-driven tools that translate learning-based techniques into effective cryptanalytic methodologies.
