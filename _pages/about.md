<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student at the School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University in China. My research interests focus on Symmetric-key Cryptography, Artificial Intelligence and Cryptanalysis. With the support of the China Scholarship Council, I received a joint training at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore for nearly two years.
